            New York City was not exempt from the ravaging of Covid-19 as it spread across the world. As the economy came to a stall, 
        small businesses, making up 98 percent of New York City’s businesses, took suffered immensely. As the city quarantined, small businesses saw less and less foot traffic. 
        Many who do not have delivery services or any online presence were unable to compete with those that do. The many New York City communities and locals found that their favorite 
        local businesses had no choice but to close as a result. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Two years after the start of Covid-19 and as the city attempts to climb its way back to its former glory, small businesses continue to struggle. One such example is that of the 
            East Village’s Stuyvesant St. PanYa, a Japanese bakery at 8 Stuyvesant St. officially closed for good on Saturday evening, April 18. This was the last of four businesses owned by 
            Yoshida Restaurant Group to close for good. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Seeing the challenges that small businesses have had to go through throughout the pandemic, on top of general challenges that small businesses face online, Scout has stepped up to 
            the plate to try to tackle the issue in their own way. Scout, a new startup, aims to provide a platform for small businesses. In today’s world that so heavily relies on the 
            digital world, Scout sees that small businesses are non-existent online. Google, the primary search engine for the vast majority of the world, has been overtaken by large 
            retailers.
        </p>
        <p>Fortunately, we were able to get in touch with one of Scout’s founders and here is what they had to say:</p>
        <p>
            “We want Scout to be a platform that is beneficial for small businesses. Small businesses have next to no visibility in dominant platforms such as Google. Big companies appear 
            multiple times over the first page of search results, a result of utilizing available extensive resources into purchasing ad space and SEO optimization. Giant retailers can spend 
            up to $50 million on Google Ads or even as much as $10,000 per month on SEO. Small businesses generally do not have such extensive resources to do the same thing. These giants 
            are able to “bid on keywords for a chance to show ads in Google search results” through Google’s pay-per-click (PPC). As a result, small- and medium-sized businesses are hidden 
            many pages deep into search engine results, which ends up hindering the growth of businesses and limiting the choices of consumers.”
        </p>
        <p>After presenting the problem that Scout is trying to serve, the founder described what solution Scout is to be:</p>
        <p>
            “Our search engine, "Scout," can affect change in two different areas. One: to break the cycle of big businesses pouring money/resources to skew search results—promoting these big businesses to the top page and multiple other placements thorough the results, e.g. dedicated product modules, near the footer, and visibility on other results tabs. For small/mid-sized business, paying cost-per-click charges represent a significant portion of their costs. Generally, small- to mid-sized companies will spend $9,000 to $10,000 per month on Google Ads. Instead, this cycle would be broken to help small businesses. 
            Two: with "Scout," consumers are not as beholden to primarily/only choosing to spend at big businesses. "Scout" will champion for small businesses that way consumers can have more choices in whom they want to support. In today's world where big businesses are found participating in immoral practices (union busting, underpaying and overworking employees, contributing to climate change and global warming, etc.) and are too powerful to feel remorse, consumers are becoming more cautious of whom they buy from and what their money is supporting. By providing more alternatives and options, consumers are able to have a shopping experience that lets them find what they need in a way that aligns with their beliefs/morals, while also supporting small businesses, entrepreneurship, and healthy competition.”
        </p>
        <p>
            We believe that Scout may just be the ticket for small businesses to grow and increase success rates. By providing small businesses with an online presence, small businesses can 
            more easily attract customers as well. For people who are serious about supporting their favorite small businesses or those who are pursuing a journey of ethical consumption, we 
            highly recommend that you give Scout a chance to prove themselves. Visit their website and leave any feedback that you have so that they can better support your favorite local 
            businesses.
